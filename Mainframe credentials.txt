The default login credentials for the MVS 3.8J Turnkey system are typically provided as part of the documentation or readme files included with the system. For the MVS 3.8J Turnkey system from the MVS Turnkey System website, the default user ID and password are usually as follows:

User ID: HERC01
Password: CUL8TR
Steps to Log In
Start Hercules:
Ensure Hercules is running and you have successfully IPLed the MVS operating system by entering ipl 150 in the Hercules console.

Open 3270 Terminal Emulator:
Open your 3270 terminal emulator (e.g., x3270 or wc3270) and connect to localhost on port 3270.

Log In:
When the MVS login screen appears, enter the following credentials:

User ID: HERC01
Password: CUL8TR

After entering the credentials, you should be logged into the MVS mainframe system.

Additional Information
Changing Passwords: It is a good practice to change the default password after your first login. You can do this using the TSO (Time Sharing Option) command 
once logged in.

Additional Users: You can create additional user IDs as needed for different users or purposes.
